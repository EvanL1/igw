//! Channel runtime trait for unified protocol management.
//!
//! This module defines the `ChannelRuntime` trait, an object-safe wrapper
//! that allows heterogeneous protocol channels to be managed uniformly.

/// Object-safe wrapper for protocol channels.
///
/// This trait provides a unified interface for managing different protocol
/// channels (Modbus, IEC104, OPC UA, etc.) in the gateway runtime.
///
/// # Design Rationale
///
/// The core protocol traits (`ProtocolClient`, `EventDrivenProtocol`) use
/// `impl Future` return types which are not object-safe. This wrapper uses
/// `async_trait` to enable dynamic dispatch via `Box<dyn ChannelRuntime>`.
#[async_trait]

    async fn connect(&mut self) -> Result<()>;

    /// Disconnect from the remote device/server.
    async fn disconnect(&mut self) -> Result<()>;

    // === Data Operations ===

    /// Poll data once (for polling channels).
    ///
    /// Event-driven channels may return cached data or empty batch.

    ///
