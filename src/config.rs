//! Configuration utilities for protocol channel construction.
//!
//! This module provides generic utilities for building protocol channels,
//! without any application-layer concepts like "四遥" (Four Remotes).
//!
//! # Design Principle
//!
//! igw is a pure protocol library. It knows about:
//! - Protocol addresses (Modbus registers, GPIO pins, CAN IDs)
//! - Protocol-specific configuration parsing
//! - Point configuration with transforms
//!
//! It does NOT know about:
//! - SCADA concepts (Telemetry, Signal, Control, Adjustment)
//! - Application-layer point categorization
//!
//! The application layer (e.g., comsrv) is responsible for:
//! - Iterating over its own point categories
//! - Calling igw's protocol parsers
//! - Building PointConfig lists

///
/// Contains both the channel instance and the parsed point configurations,
/// which the application layer may need for routing/storage.
